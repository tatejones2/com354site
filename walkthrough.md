# Walkthrough - Add Markdown Files

I have added the standard agent markdown files to your workspace to help track the project status.

## Changes

### Workspace
- Added `task.md`: Tracks current and future tasks.
- Added `implementation_plan.md`: detailed technical plans for changes.
- Added `walkthrough.md`: This file, for tracking completion and verification.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Verified files exist in the workspace root.
